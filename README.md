## DH150 Assignment 1: Heuristic Evaluation by Alondra Orn

#### Website 1: Craiglist
https://orangecounty.craigslist.org/

I chose this website because it’s so popular yet its website is so dull, outdated and tacky looking. I thought it would be interesting to see the ways in which I could improve such a popular website that I myself frequently visit. I was mostly inspired to redesign this website because it is so relevant to my life as well as my family. We have all sold a few items off this website. Craigslist's UX design has not changed for years from when it started. A common saying that is associated with this website is “why fix something if it’s not broken”, however, I feel like there is so much more that Craigslist can improve on to improve its user efficiency.
