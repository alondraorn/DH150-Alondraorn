## DH150 Assignment 1: Heuristic Evaluation by Alondra Orn

#### Website 1: Craiglist
https://orangecounty.craigslist.org/

I chose this website because it’s so popular yet its website is so dull, outdated and tacky looking. I thought it would be interesting to see the ways in which I could improve such a popular website that I myself frequently visit. I was mostly inspired to redesign this website because it is so relevant to my life as well as my family. We have all sold a few items off this website. Craigslist's UX design has not changed for years from when it started. A common saying that is associated with this website is “why fix something if it’s not broken”, however, I feel like there is so much more that Craigslist can improve on to improve its user efficiency.

#### Website 1: SpaceJam
https://spacejam.com/jam.htm

I chose this website because I love the 90s aesthetic that SpaceJam embodies. I thought I would have a lot of fun working with a website that has a graphic design that I already enjoy. Also, with a SpaceJam remake coming out, it would be cool to see how I could improve this website so that it appeals to the vast majority. My initial thoughts on this website is that is very outdated for today’s graphic trends, however, “Space Jam” was made in the 90s so I thought the design was done purposefully to mimic the feel of 90s websites, however, I think that you can still maintain the aesthetic and stay true the time of the show while also maintaining an efficient user experience. I think it would be a lot of fun to redesign this website.

## Evaluation
#### Heuristic Evaluation Scale
1 = Minor Problen: Does not need to be fixed urgently, only when there's extra time available

2 = Moderate Problem: Minor problem and needs to be given low priority

3 = Major Usability Problem: Needs to be given high priority to be fixed

### Visibility of System Status

#### Craigslist
- (1) Craiglsist has no way of keeping visitors informed about the status of the process, when you post something to sell, there is no uploading page where you can see the progress
- This is confusing because you can’t tell if your post was successfully uploaded without refreshing the whole website and going into the forum to check yourself


#### SpaceJam
- (1)When jumping in between screens, like “stellar souvenirs” or Jam, there is no screen that shows that the website is  loading
- This is troublesome, because I was caught countless times clicking the button because I did not know that the screen was still loading

### Match Between System and the Real World

#### Craigslist
- (3) A main downfall of Craislist is that there is no symbol communications with the real world, the only way to navigate through this page is to read. The only thing that stands out besides the words is another word--marked in orange; this is indicative of a post with a picture or a new post
- (0) Trash can icon tells you that you can hide a post which makes this process intuitive
- (3) When looking at the main page, there are no symbols to tell you what is what

#### SpaceJam
- (3)There are a few symbols that indicate what will happen if I click on it. For instance, the CD icon leads to the movie soundtrack page
- (3)When clicking on any of the tabs like “Junior Jam”, it leads you to a page where nothing makes sense unless you read all the text on the page
- (3)There are no symbols or very few that are indicative of anything 
- (3)Where there is an archive, there are no camera or photo icons to symbolize this is where you will fine “photos from the film”

### User Control and Freedom

#### Craigslist
- (2)When clicking on a specific tab like “real estate” there is no easy way to exit and choose another forum, it would be useful if each tab was a window so that you can exit out and enter another one easily. Would be convenient if the other sections were available on the tab to the left
- (2)Also extremely difficult to exit out of post within a forum, if you were looking for homes under pressed time, it would be very annoying to constantly have to click the back button and skim through the searches again

#### SpaceJam
- (3)There is no way to exit out of anything, the only way to do so is to hit the back arrow. Like I suggested with Craigslist, there should be a minimize screen for each tab so it’s easier to explore the other categories

### Consistency and Standards 

#### Craigslist
- (1)The account page is not on upper right hand side like most websites are and there is no “sign in” option like most websites thus making it less intuitive to the user; because it does not have the standard format like most websites, it makes it a little difficult to navigate through this website if you are a first time user
- (1)The favorite, huge and flag option should be in the center of the page and not to the left I believe since these are buttons you would click more frequently

#### SpaceJam
- (3)This isn’t your traditional website, when you click on “screensavers” it sends you to a page where nothing is standard about it except the tab bar on the left which gives you easy access to the other categories of the website
- (3)Different subcategories within the categories are separated within an image rather than by tabs, not as intuitive to the user today, it may just look like a picture and not something you can click on to navigate through the website

### Error Prevention

#### Craigslist
- (0)When trying to make your own post, there is a lot of message pop ups that tell you if information is incorrect of missing and thus, stopping you from moving onto the next step
- (0)Looks like it’s hard to make a mistake when making your own posting on this website, which is good

#### SpaceJam
- (1)This website doesn’t do a good job when telling you if you are going to be redirected to another website, there should be an error message or some sort of pop up telling you that you cannot find the specific information in the website and thus it will transfer you

### Recognition rather than recall

#### Craigslist
- (3)This website doesn’t have the option to view most recent searches
- (3)You don’t have the option to look at which forum you are visiting more frequently, which would be helpful if you are on this website to look for a job and need this forum easily retrievable
- (3)Doesn’t save your searches in the search bar either making it difficult to find previous things based on your suggestion. I feel like you are usually on Craigslist to look for the same things you had visited the website for prior so to not have this suggestions or most frequented tab makes the website a lot less efficient

#### SpaceJam
- (2)Just like Craigslist, there is no way to know which sections of the SpaceJam website you have frequently visited
- (2)There is no way to look through your history
- (3)There is no way to see which music you downloaded already 
- (3) It’s hard to keep track of what you’ve explored and what you haven’t already, it would be convenient if explored tabs were marked in a different color

### Flexibility and efficiency of Use

#### Craigslist
- (3)When clicking on a certain forum from the community tab, like “Rants and Raves” there is no tab on the left to indicate what date you want to see posts from or from what area/location

#### SpaceJam
- (2)This website has no efficiencies, there is no way to categorize or limit your search, the only option available is the 13 categories offered on the left tab marked by planets. However once you enter a category it’s hard to go through the other categories without having to go back to the main page and click on the planet again

### Aesthetic and minimalist design

#### Craigslist
- (0)No space is wasted on Craigslist's website; the site does an amazing job on keeping its main page simple and straight to the point
- (2)Although it has a very minimalistic design, I don’t think the layout of where the titles and certain categories are placed in an efficient manner

#### SpaceJam
- (3)This website looks like it was made from the 90s; it is decorated with crazy, multicolored fonts which is fine if it matches the theme of the show, however, there is no color scheme and the color palette is excessive and too dramatic 
- (3)The background for each page changes and is very jarring
- (3)The typography doesn’t match the other typography within the same page

### Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors

#### Craigslist
- (2)When typing in the search bar, an incorrect word, it gives you the notification that nothing is found for that search, however it doesn’t give you helpful information besides, “all words must match” which doesn’t make much sense to me

#### SpaceJam
- (2)When playing the games available on this website, there are some games that don’t work; however, there is no error screen that tells you that it’s broken or how to fix to or what to do instead

### Help and documentation

#### Craigslist
- (2)The help tab was easy to find if you can read well, however there are no easy way to single it out since it’s the same font and size as everything else 
- (3)Why aren’t the titles of any of the subheaders capitalized
(0)Each category for the help page is separated by a bold grey box, which helps the user more efficiently find answers to their questions
(3)The titles of each subheader could be organized and named better. For instance, what does “classified postings mean." These titles aren’t really questions either.

#### SpaceJam
- (3)There is no help or documentation page, or if there is it is extremely hard to find
